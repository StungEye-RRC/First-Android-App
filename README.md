# First Android App Developer Log

2018-01-08 - Created my first Android project ([following this tutorial](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html)) and configured Android Studio. This included setting up the emulator and associated Android SDK, as well as configuring the IDE to work with git and my Github account. I'm able to build the project and view the "Hello World" app in the emulator. I can also perform git commits and push to a Github repo (this one). Continuing with the tutorial I added a textbox and button to the UI using the Blueprint UI design view. The tutorial drifted a bit from what I was seeing in the editor here, but I was able to make things work. My initial thoughts on the UI editor is that looks very complicated but powerful. Next step for this tutorial is to open a new activity when the button I just added is clicked.
